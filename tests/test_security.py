"""
Tests for app/core/security.py -- the admin API key dependency added to
fix the CORS + missing-auth issue (see HOW_TO_APPLY_FIXES.md).

These call the dependency function directly rather than going through a
FastAPI TestClient + full app lifespan (which would need a live MongoDB
and MQTT broker to start up). That mirrors how the rest of this test
suite already tests service-layer functions directly.

Note: this file was written and reasoned through carefully, but I could
not execute it in the sandbox this session ran in (fastapi /
pydantic-settings aren't installed there and the sandbox has no package
registry access). Please run `pytest tests/test_security.py -v` yourself
after applying the fix to confirm it passes before you rely on it.
